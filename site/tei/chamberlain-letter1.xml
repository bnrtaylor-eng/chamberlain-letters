        <p>Goode Master Carleton, I know you lookt longe ere this time to have<lb /> 
          heard from me, and so might you well have don, yf Painter the post had<lb /> 
          not kept your letter of the eight of May aseasoninge till the sixt of this<lb /> 
          present June.</p> 
        
         <seg type="topic" n="family-finances"/>
        <p>I received a litle billet before, by your sister Williams,<note>Elizabeth, wife of Alexander Williams,</note><lb />
          in the way of an interim till you had better leasure, but presently upon<lb /> 
          yt went to Askot<note>Ascott, Oxfordshire, the home of Michael Dormer (knighted, 1604).</note> where I met with your brother Carleton<note>George Carleton of Huntercombe, Oxfordshire.</note> (comming<lb /> 
          from the buriall of your uncle Goodwin,)<note>Brother of Carleton's mother, and son of John Goodwin.</note> who told me Tobie Mathew<note>Knighted, 1623. Son of Tobias Matthew, Bishop of Durham, and later Archbishop of York.</note><lb />
          had shewed him a letter from you wherin you complained much of want,<lb /> 
          and what narrow straights you were like to be driven to, marvayling you<lb /> 
          had toucht no such matter in your letters to him : and therewithall began<lb /> 
          to dilate to me what he had don and could do for you, but the conclusion<lb /> 
          was that his abilitie is not to supplie all wants, and therefore you must<lb /> 
          trust to yourself and make your owne fortune. I replied litle to yt but<lb /> 
          only in generall termes, the rather because I hope yt is but a borrowed<lb /> 
          complaint to distast younge Mathew from following you into Fraunce,<lb /> 
          then for any true cause.</p>

        <p>I am exceding glad to heare how well you are<lb /> 
          entertained by my Lord Ambassador :<note>Sir Anthony Mildmay, ambassador to Henry IV.</note> of whom I presumed no lesse, for<lb /> 
          though I alwayes knewe him to be <hi rend="italics" xml:lang="la">paucorum hominem</hi>, yet he hath ever<lb />

He was Lord Deputy from 1594 to 1597. "Russell was called home; and in his place was substituted Lord Deputy Thomas Lord Borrough, a sharp man, and full of courage, but of little skill in the warres; and this beyond the opinion of all men, and altogether against the expectation of Norris, who in respect of his deserts, and skill in military matters, had promised to himselfe this place. . . and now overcome with griefe of minde, fell sicke, and shortly after died." (Camden, <hi rend="italics">Annales</hi>, p. 482.) Queen Elizabeth wrote his mother a beautiful letter of condolence, September 22, 1597. (S. P. Dom. Eliz., cclxiv, 118.)</note> is come<lb />

        <p>We have great preparation here for a sea viage,<note>The expedition usually known as the Islands Voyage. The leaders hoped to destroy the Spanish war fleet in the harbor of Ferrol or at sea, to capture the treasure and merchant fleets from the West and East Indies, and to establish a foothold in the Azores.

        in mine opinion, is to set upon the King of Spaines navie whersoever<lb /> 
        they can finde yt, or to meet with the Indian fleet. Theyre whole num-<lb />
        ber consists of fifteen of the Quenes shippes, besides the two Spanish<lb /> 
        shippes that were taken the last yeare, (which be new fashioned after the<lb /> 
        English manner), and of two and twentie men of warre of Holland,<lb /> 
        and some fowre and twentie flieboats and hoyes that serve for cariage of<lb />

        voluntaries are thought will rise towardes 2000. The erle of Essex<note>Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth's troublesome young favorite.</note><lb />

        <p>This letter offers a vivid window into Chamberlain’s early correspondence with Dudley Carleton. Written from London on June 11, 1597, it addresses Carleton’s financial worries, relayed through a report from his brother about a letter shown by Tobie Mathew. Chamberlain tactfully avoids direct comment, suggesting the complaint may have been strategic. The letter also includes intelligence on Irish military affairs, particularly the return of Sir William Russell and the death of Feogh MacHugh, along with preparations for the Islands Voyage, a planned naval expedition against Spanish forces. Court news features prominently, including the deaths of several figures, a set of new appointments, and social gossip involving marriages and ambitions. Chamberlain concludes with his own decision to travel to Ireland with the Wallop and Lytton families. Throughout, he demonstrates his emerging role as an informal correspondent and observer of political and social developments.</p>
